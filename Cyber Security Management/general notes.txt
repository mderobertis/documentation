How do I qualify for a certificate?

This short course has been designed so that it mirrors our standard subjects. Therefore, to attain the certificate of completion, you will need to complete all hurdle activities. Once you complete the requirements they will be automatically marked complete on this course page. The activity hurdles for this course consist of the following:


Weekly quizzes. You must receive a pass mark in all quizzes to sit the Final Exam. The pass mark is 50%.
Final Exam. You must receive a pass mark in the final exam. The pass mark is 50%.

Please note that all activities and the final exam must be completed before the end of the official certification period for you to be eligible for a certificate of completion.

Please note that the weekly quizzes are participation requirements only. You will need to complete them to sit your final exam, however, your final mark is derived from your exam score and, in a small measure, forum participation.
